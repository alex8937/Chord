# Chord

In computing, Chord is a protocol and algorithm for a peer-to-peer distributed hash table. A distributed hash table stores key-value pairs by assigning keys to different computers (known as "nodes"); a node will store the values for all the keys for which it is responsible. Chord specifies how keys are assigned to nodes, and how a node can discover the value for a given key by first locating the node responsible for that key.

## Highlight

With a finger table, the number of nodes that must be contacted to find a successor in an N-node network is O(logN), which has been confirmed by the result of the project
